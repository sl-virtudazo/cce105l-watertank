	Water Tank Monitoring System (with Abstraction)

A Java-based simulation for managing water tanks that demonstrates OOP concepts and user interaction through the JOptionPane class.

	What the Project Does:
The Water Tank Monitoring System is a Java program for managing water tanks. It utilizes the JOptionPane class from the javax.swing package to provide dialog-based interaction, offering a more intuitive and user-friendly experience compared to console-based input. The system defines an abstract class with water tank operations and two subclasses representing different tank types with specific capacities. Users can fill tanks, consume water, and check tank status after each operation.

	Why the Project Is Useful:
This project highlights essential object-oriented programming concepts and is valuable for students, beginners, developers, and educators.
